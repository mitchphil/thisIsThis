Submission for 2021 Fintech Algothon - Discrete Momentum Trading Model


Our team developed a predictive model to trade the market using machine learning to train our model to interpret technical indicators and produce buy and sell calls based on where it predicts the market direction is headed per individual stock. the three jupyter notebooks contain the code which was used to develop the three discrete models which make prediction whether; 1. 3 daily price growth per stock is greater than  or less than 1.5%, or within that range, 2. the price will rise or fall the following day, 3. the price will rise or fall the following day by a margin that is greater than the rate of commission. Then, with a position size determing function in the thisIsThis.py file, we utilise the brief and its unlimited liquidty, to minimise risk and to produce consistently profitable returns. It is also worth noting that the precision and reliability of the model will drastically improve with more than the 200 days of data provided in the preliminary stages.
